EMG Physical Dataset to Classify Activities.

Dataset consists of electrical signals recorded from 8 total muscles; biceps & triceps of both arms
and hamstrings and thigh muscles of the legs.

This dataset has no target variable as such. Based on my intuition, I've decided to make a classification
model and so I appended an extra column in each of the datasets to signify if they were an aggressive activity (1)
or a normal activity (0).

Note: I've decided to implement a regular challenge for myself to improve my data science skills.
Therefore, I generate a random link to a dataset available on the UCI ML Repository and build a machine learning model
to analyze the data.

GitHub profile for the Dataset-Randomizer repository.
